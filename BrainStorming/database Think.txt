Tables I think we will need:


Case :
	id
	name
	description
	status_id ( refer to status table )
	address_id ( refer to address table )
	user_id
	done->default(false)

status :
	id
	name


Organization :
	id
	name
	address_id
	owner_id ( refer to users table )

Address :
	id
	state:
	region:
	street:
	building:
